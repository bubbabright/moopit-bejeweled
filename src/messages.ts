/**
 * Every line the game says out loud, in two voices.
 *
 * - `plain` — the default. This is the wording the game has always used, and it stays put:
 *   the screenshots and the playtest are checked against this build.
 * - `moopit` — a private pack of in-jokes. Off unless a player unlocks it, and the choice is
 *   remembered in settings. See `MOOPIT_TAPS` and `MenuScene.wireMoopitTitle`.
 *
 * House rule for the personal voice: it does not belong in README.md or on the game page.
 * The game is public; this half of it is between two people, and the surprise only lands once.
 *
 * One name from the source list is deliberately absent here. It was marked off-limits, and
 * this repo is public, so it is not written down anywhere — including in this comment.
